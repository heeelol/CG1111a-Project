# CG1111a-Project
This repo contains the full documentation for our CG1111A project at the National University of Singapore.
Our goal: design and program an autonomous mBot that can navigate a maze using color detection and sensor feedback.

###ðŸŽ¯ Task Objective

- Navigate a maze autonomously using LDR and RGB LEDs

- Detect black lines and determine directional movement via color tiles

- Adjust angle using ultrasonic and IR sensors to stay centered

- Play a melody when reaching the white tile (end goal)

âœ… Achievements

- Successfully completed the maze without human intervention

- Accurate real-time color detection using boolean logic

- Responsive movement with dynamic angle corrections

- Robust performance even under ambient light and sensor noise

ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills

- Arduino C++ Programming

- Sensor Calibration & Tuning (LDR, IR, Ultrasonic)

- Embedded Systems & Control Logic

- Hardware Troubleshooting & Wiring Optimization

- Iterative Design & Test Methodology
